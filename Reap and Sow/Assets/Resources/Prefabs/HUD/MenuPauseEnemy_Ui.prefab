  - This plant is quite different from any that I have experience with, as none that
    I know act with such ferocity to actively kill a target. These soldiers always
    try to keep their distance and fire at me, however they are quite slow. My previous
    work in botany tells me this forest warps the known logic of plants.
  - "This is quite the odd creature. I don\u2019t recognize it to be similar to any
    wildlife or plants that I know of. It does seem to be aggressive as it charges
    at me when it notices my presence. It seems to have healing properties, but is
    unable to use them itself. I wonder how a creature like this came to be and why
    it heals those who consume it?"
  - When I first encountered this plant, I saw that it was shaking but saw nothing
    else nearby till some pinecones dropped. This plant produces pinecones that are
    different from pinecones outside the forest. These pinecones have explosive properties
    that I suspect come from the seeds inside the pinecones. The Pinecone Grenadier
    shakes itself in ways unlike other trees, allowing it to release its pinecones
    with no care for what is nearby.
  - "While this lion has been altered by the forest, it still maintained its usual
    hunting behaviors when I encountered it. They stalked from a distance and struck
    at moments I didn\u2019t expect with a burst of speed. The best I could do was
    to keep moving. It seems that the forest has changed its fur to green and covered
    it in purple vines."
  - When I first saw this plant, I immediately noticed the similarities it shares
    with the Crawling Thornslinger, though it has grown in height to a massive degree.
    Also, unlike the crawling thornslinger, this plant has 3 heads that all work
    together to attack. Its third head, a giant eye, was also protected until I killed
    the other two heads, though it was not as strong.
  - 
  - Flames were something that were terrifying the first time I saw them when encountering
    this plant. It uses the other trees around here to shoot flaming wood projectiles.
    It has a hole in the heartwood that it uses to launch the projectiles.
  - "This group of ants is quite different from the ones outside this forest. I\u2019ve
    seen them group up together in random places and generate flame tornadoes. Unfortunately,
    their size stops me from landing a hit. Luckily though, they have no true target.
    I should keep an eye out for any groups forming."
  - "This plant was much more dangerous than the others that I have encountered.
    It might have been what caused this part of the forest to have all of the\u2026
    damage. It used fire to keep me away from it and would attack with fire tornadoes.
    I was lucky that it was low on fuel, as otherwise I don\u2019t think I could
    have ever attacked it."
  - Unlike the Venus Flytrap, which references beauty to lure in food, this species
    is known as the Icarus Legtrap, to warn others to keep a distance. Different
    from the Venus Flytrap, this plant moves around to different positions to replant
    itself and wait for prey to approach, which is what I should keep an eye out
    for.
  - "This Corpsebloom is quite different from the version outside these forests.
    The smell of this Corpsebloom is life threatening, as my first smell of it caused
    me serious pain. I\u2019ve come across this plant hanging off of different structures
    such as trees or walls."
